## Vote

The next transactions were done by the voters:

10 votes to ubuntu: https://sepolia.etherscan.io/tx/0x451c4ee8cca5da3817a2a5fc5da12138e5e2e0e266a7a61ec9f6bee5d2fbba87

90 votes to ubuntu (same voter than in the previous transaction): https://sepolia.etherscan.io/tx/0x162f9b748f24bb698899f8d2955cf94cced6bbd9262fd6cb2fa6a5bf5005c5e4

## Vote reverted (not more tokens to vote)

https://sepolia.etherscan.io/tx/0x73faaaf71242161f755aaaaea3d823b929669f104b5f436af9d94d12c776f9df

## Interesting thing to note

Adding `{ gasLimit: 50000 }` to the transaction calls allowed us to always register the transaction on the network. Without this parameter, the transaction was rejected before it was sent to the network, and the error appeared in the terminal.

As a result, the rejected transactions were not visible as evidence in the block explorer. After adding the gas limit, they were.

Here is an example about how we used it:

```typescript
await ballotContract.vote(proposal, { gasLimit: 50000 });
```
