## Rejected delegate vote: already voted.

This transaction was made by a participant who had already voted. As expected, it was rejected:

https://sepolia.etherscan.io/tx/0x75ff7d704b3671156d13dc30f4e768e07f7cd6edd29c7b831a02cb6e0ece23cb

## Interesting thing to note

Adding `{ gasLimit: 50000 }` to the transaction calls allowed us to always register the transaction on the network. Without this parameter, the transaction was rejected before it was sent to the network, and the error appeared in the terminal.

As a result, the rejected transactions were not visible as evidence in the block explorer. After adding the gas limit, they were.

Here is an example about how we used it:

```typescript
await ballotContract.vote(proposal, { gasLimit: 50000 });
```
